# Destiny üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Atypical


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Vaishakh Suresh - Government College of Engineering Kannur

### Project Description
Ever wondered what it feels like to be universally liked? With Destiny, you get to match with me, no matter what! Swipe right or left, it doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äîyou‚Äôre stuck with me!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Dating apps have become too serious and selective. What if there was a world where everyone matched with the least desirable person? Think of the fun! My crush once told me that I‚Äôd be the last person in the world she‚Äôd date, so I thought, ‚ÄúChallenge accepted!‚Äù

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Destiny solves the nonexistent problem of feeling unwanted by ensuring everyone matches with me. Plus, if you dare to swipe right on someone else, a friendly(maybe not) pop-up will remind you of your questionable choices. Who needs rejection when you can have destiny?

*However, there's a twist! Regardless of whether the user likes or dislikes my card, I still match with the user ;)*
